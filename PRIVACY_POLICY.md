# Privacy Policy – Quick QR & Barcode Toolkit

Last updated: 7 September 2025

Quick QR & Barcode Toolkit (the “App”) allows you to scan barcodes and QR codes, generate new QR codes, share results, and keep an optional on‑device history. We respect your privacy and designed the App to work without collecting, storing, or transferring personal data to our servers.

If you have questions, contact: cbishal6@gmail.com

## Scope

This policy applies to the Android version of the App published under the package name “receiptbill”.

## Information We Collect

We designed the App to minimize data collection. Specifically:

1. Camera Access (Required for scanning)
   - Purpose: To read barcodes/QR codes using your device camera.
   - Storage/Transmission: Camera frames are processed in real time on the device. They are not sent to us or any third‑party server.

2. Content You Scan or Generate
   - When you scan a code or generate a QR code, the resulting text/URL is shown to you in the App. This content is not uploaded to us.
   - If you choose to save results to History, they are stored locally on your device only (see Local Storage below).

3. Local Storage (On‑device history)
   - The App uses Android’s SharedPreferences to store your saved history entries (content, format, timestamp) locally.
   - You can delete single items or clear all history from within the App at any time.
   - We do not have access to this local data.

4. Optional Sharing
   - If you tap Share, the App passes the selected text/QR image to the Android system share sheet. What happens next depends on the app you choose (e.g., email, messaging). Any data you send via sharing is handled by that chosen app under its own privacy policy and is outside our control.

5. Logs, Analytics, Identifiers
   - We do not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, crash reports, or telemetry from within the App.

## What We Do Not Collect

- No account registration.
- No personal profile.
- No cloud backups by us.
- No background location, contacts, or microphone data.
- No advertising SDKs.

## How We Use Information

- Provide core functionality: barcode/QR scanning, QR generation, sharing.
- Maintain your on‑device history (if you choose to save).
- Improve reliability and user experience through on‑device logic only. We do not process your data on remote servers.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- History items you save remain on your device until you delete them or clear all history from the App.
- Uninstalling the App removes the App and its local data from your device.

## Third‑Party Services and SDKs

The App relies on open‑source components that run on‑device:
- mobile_scanner (camera scanning)
- qr_flutter (QR generation)
- shared_preferences (local storage)
- share_plus (system share sheet)
- permission_handler (runtime permission requests)

These libraries execute on your device and do not send your content to their own servers. Any sharing you initiate uses the chosen target app’s services, which are governed by those apps’ own policies.

## Permissions Used (Android)

- CAMERA: required to scan barcodes and QR codes.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because we do not collect data, any concerns can be resolved by uninstalling the App and clearing local history.

## Security

Because we do not operate servers for this App, your data remains on your device unless you choose to share it. Please keep your device secure and updated to protect local data (e.g., screen lock, OS updates).

## International Data Transfers

We do not transfer your data internationally because we do not collect or store your data on our servers.

## Your Choices and Controls

- You can choose not to grant the camera permission; scanning will be disabled until granted.
- You can choose what, if anything, to save to History, and you can delete entries or clear all History.
- You can choose if and how to share content through other apps.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. We will update the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
